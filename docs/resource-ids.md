# Resource IDs

Every Pulumi resource must have an `"id"` field. `"id"` must be a string, and it must be
set by the provider (`Computed` and *not* `Optional` in Terraform parlance).

## SDKv1 and SDKv2 Based Providers

The ID requirement is easy to satisfy for SDKv{1,2} based providers since both SDKs
require an ID field of type string set on the provider. If the provider being bridged is
based on SDKv1 or SDKv2, then the bridge handles Pulumi's ID field without intervention.

## PF Based Providers

Most PF based providers have an attribute called `"id"` of the right kind for the bridge
to use. If your provider doesn't, then you will see an error when `make tfgen` is
run. Each error has a different kind of resolution.

### ID of the wrong type

```
error: Resource dnsimple_email_forward has a problem: "id" attribute is of type "int", expected type "string". To map this resource consider overriding the SchemaInfo.Type field or specifying ResourceInfo.ComputeID.
```

This error happens when the upstream resource has an ID but it's not a string. If the ID
attribute type is coercible to a string, you can fix it by setting the `SchemaInfo.Type` override
for the `"id"` field:

```go
			"dnsimple_email_forward": {
				Fields: map[string]*tfbridge.SchemaInfo{
					"id": {Type: "string"},
				},
			},
```


For providers[^1] where every resource's ID has the wrong type, you can use a `for` loop to apply this:

```go
	prov.P.ResourcesMap().Range(func(key string, value shim.Resource) bool {
		if value.Schema().Get("id").Type() != shim.TypeString {
			r := prov.Resources[key]
			if r.Fields == nil {
				r.Fields = make(map[string]*tfbridge.SchemaInfo, 1)
			}
			r.Fields["id"] = &tfbridge.SchemaInfo{Type: "string"}
		}
		return true
	})
```

If the type of the `"id"` attribute is not coercible to a string, you must set `ResourceInfo.ComputeID`.

### ID field is missing

```
error: Resource test_res has a problem: no "id" attribute. To map this resource consider specifying ResourceInfo.ComputeID
```

If the resource simply doesn't have an `"id"` attribute, you will need to set `ResourceInfo.ComputeID`. If you want to delegate the ID field in Pulumi to another attribute, you should use `tfbridge.DelegateIDField` to produce a `ResourceInfo.ComputeID` compatible function. Otherwise you can pass in any function that complies with:

```go
func(ctx context.Context, state resource.PropertyMap) (resource.ID, error)
```
