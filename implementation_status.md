# Implementation Plan Status

## Documents Updated for Architects

All implementation plans have been updated to use the complete predicate-based system instead of simple warnings.

### 1. Full Implementation Plan
**File:** `field_level_delete_before_replace_plan.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete predicate system (567 lines)
- **Scope:** Full 9-week implementation with all predicate types
- **Content:** Complete architecture, all predicate types, cross-framework support

### 2. MVP Implementation Plan  
**File:** `mvp_field_delete_before_replace.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Updated to use predicate framework
- **Scope:** 3-week MVP with just `fieldChanged` predicate
- **Content:** Simplified predicate system, GCP + Linode examples

### 3. Developer Documentation
**File:** `docs/guides/field-level-delete-before-replace.md`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete predicate system with all types
- **Scope:** Provider developer guide
- **Content:** All predicate types, GCP/AWS/Linode examples, testing guidance

## Key Changes Made

### Architecture Consistency
- All documents now use the `DeleteBeforeReplaceEvaluator` struct
- Predicate-based configuration throughout
- Consistent type definitions across all plans

### Enhanced Examples
- **GCP:** `enable_private_nodes` and `machine_type` with `fieldChanged` predicates
- **Linode:** `root_pass` with `fieldChanged` predicate  
- **AWS:** Updated to use predicate system
- **Complete predicate types:** `fieldChanged`, `hasAttachedResources`, `fieldEquals`, `fieldMatches`, `resourceCount`

### Developer-Focused Content
- Comprehensive predicate configuration examples
- Testing strategies for provider developers
- Migration guidance from simple boolean to predicate-based
- Best practices for warning message writing

## Ready for Architecture Review

The implementation plans now provide:

1. **Consistent Architecture:** All documents use the same predicate-based system
2. **Scalable Foundation:** MVP uses simplified predicate framework that extends to full system
3. **Real Examples:** GCP and Linode examples matching the original GitHub issues
4. **Complete Testing:** Comprehensive test examples for provider developers
5. **Clear Migration Path:** From MVP → Full Implementation → Stable Release

Both the MVP (3 weeks) and full implementation (9 weeks) are ready for architectural review and team discussion.
