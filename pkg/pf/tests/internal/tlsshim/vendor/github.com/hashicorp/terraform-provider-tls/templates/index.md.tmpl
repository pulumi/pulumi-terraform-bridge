# {{ .ProviderShortName | upper }} Provider

The TLS provider provides utilities for working with *Transport Layer Security*
keys and certificates. It provides resources that
allow private keys, certificates and certificate requests to be
created as part of a Terraform deployment.

Another name for Transport Layer Security is *Secure Sockets Layer*,
or SSL. TLS and SSL are equivalent when considering the resources
managed by this provider.

This provider is not particularly useful on its own, but it can be
used to create certificates and credentials that can then be used
with other providers when creating resources that expose TLS
services or that themselves provision TLS certificates.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Limitations

### `ECDSA` with `P224` elliptic curve

When using `ECDSA` with `P224`, all the (computed) attributes
that have to do with [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) will have a value of `""` (empty string).
This applies to different resources and data sources offered by this provider,
like the `tls_private_key` resource or the `tls_public_key` data source.

The attributes affected are:

* `.public_key_openssh`
* `.private_key_openssh`
* `.public_key_fingerprint_md5`
* `.public_key_fingerprint_sha256`

This is because the SSH ECC Algorithm Integration ([RFC 5656](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5656))
restricts support for elliptic curves to "nistp256", "nistp384" and "nistp521".

### Secrets and Terraform state

Some resources that can be created with this provider, like `tls_private_key`, are
considered "secrets", and as such are marked by this provider as _sensitive_, so to
help practitioner to not accidentally leak their value in logs or other form of output.

It's important to remember that the values that constitute the "state" of those
resources will be stored in the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state) file.
This includes the "secrets", that will be part of the state file *unencrypted*.

Because of these limitations, **use of these resources for production deployments is _not_ recommended**.
Failing that, **protecting the content of the state file is strongly recommended**.

The more general advice is that it's better to generate "secrets" outside of Terraform,
and then distribute them securely to the system where Terraform will make use of them.
