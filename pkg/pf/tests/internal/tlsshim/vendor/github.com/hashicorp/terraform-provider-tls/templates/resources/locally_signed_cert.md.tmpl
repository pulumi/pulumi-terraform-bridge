-> **Note** Locally-signed certificates are generally only trusted by client software when
setup to use the provided CA. They are normally used in development environments
or when deployed internally to an organization.

## Example Usage

## Automatic Renewal

This resource considers its instances to have been deleted after either their validity
periods ends (i.e. beyond the `validity_period_hours`)
or the early renewal period is reached (i.e. within the `early_renewal_hours`):
when this happens, the `ready_for_renewal` attribute will be `true`.
At this time, applying the Terraform configuration will cause a new certificate to be
generated for the instance.

Therefore in a development environment with frequent deployments it may be convenient
to set a relatively-short expiration time and use early renewal to automatically provision
a new certificate when the current one is about to expire.

The creation of a new certificate may of course cause dependent resources to be updated
or replaced, depending on the lifecycle rules applying to those resources.
