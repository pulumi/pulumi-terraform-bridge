# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

~> **Security Notice** The private key generated by this resource will
be stored *unencrypted* in your Terraform state file. **Use of this resource
for production deployments is *not* recommended**. Instead, generate
a private key file outside of Terraform and distribute it securely
to the system where Terraform will be run.

This is a *logical resource*, so it contributes only to the current Terraform
state and does not create any external managed resources.


## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/tls_private_key/resource.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Generating a New Key

Since a private key is a logical resource that lives only in the Terraform state,
it will persist until it is explicitly destroyed by the user.

In order to force the generation of a new key within an existing state, the
private key instance can be "tainted":

```
terraform taint tls_private_key.example
```

A new key will then be generated on the next ``terraform apply``.
