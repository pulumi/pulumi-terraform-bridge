~> **Warning** Self-signed certificates are usually used only in development environments
or applications deployed internally to an organization.
Certificates of this type are generally not trusted by client software such
as web browsers. Therefore clients are likely to generate trust warnings when
connecting to a server that has a self-signed certificate. 

## Example Usage

## Automatic Renewal

This resource considers its instances to have been deleted after either their validity
periods ends (i.e. beyond the `validity_period_hours`)
or the early renewal period is reached (i.e. within the `early_renewal_hours`):
when this happens, the `ready_for_renewal` attribute will be `true`.
At this time, applying the Terraform configuration will cause a new certificate to be
generated for the instance.

Therefore in a development environment with frequent deployments it may be convenient
to set a relatively-short expiration time and use early renewal to automatically provision
a new certificate when the current one is about to expire.

The creation of a new certificate may of course cause dependent resources to be updated
or replaced, depending on the lifecycle rules applying to those resources.
