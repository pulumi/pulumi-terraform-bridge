# TLS Provider

The TLS provider provides utilities for working with *Transport Layer Security*
keys and certificates. It provides resources that
allow private keys, certificates and certificate requests to be
created as part of a Terraform deployment.

Another name for Transport Layer Security is *Secure Sockets Layer*,
or SSL. TLS and SSL are equivalent when considering the resources
managed by this provider.

This provider is not particularly useful on its own, but it can be
used to create certificates and credentials that can then be used
with other providers when creating resources that expose TLS
services or that themselves provision TLS certificates.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This example creates a self-signed certificate,
# and uses it to create an AWS IAM Server certificate.
#
# THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION SERVICES.
# See the detailed documentation of each resource for further
# security considerations and other practical tradeoffs.

resource "tls_private_key" "example" {
  algorithm = "ECDSA"
}

resource "tls_self_signed_cert" "example" {
  key_algorithm   = tls_private_key.example.algorithm
  private_key_pem = tls_private_key.example.private_key_pem

  # Certificate expires after 12 hours.
  validity_period_hours = 12

  # Generate a new certificate if Terraform is run within three
  # hours of the certificate's expiration time.
  early_renewal_hours = 3

  # Reasonable set of uses for a server SSL certificate.
  allowed_uses = [
    "key_encipherment",
    "digital_signature",
    "server_auth",
  ]

  dns_names = ["example.com", "example.net"]

  subject {
    common_name  = "example.com"
    organization = "ACME Examples, Inc"
  }
}

# For example, this can be used to populate an AWS IAM server certificate.
resource "aws_iam_server_certificate" "example" {
  name             = "example_self_signed_cert"
  certificate_body = tls_self_signed_cert.example.cert_pem
  private_key      = tls_private_key.example.private_key_pem
}
```

### Configuring Proxy

```terraform
# This example fetches the TLS certificate chain
# from `example.com` using an HTTP Proxy.

provider "tls" {
  proxy {
    url = "https://corporate.proxy.service"
  }
}

data "tls_certificate" "test" {
  url = "https://example.com"
}
```

```terraform
# This example fetches the TLS certificate chain
# from `example.com` using an HTTP Proxy.
# The Proxy is discovered via environment variables:
# see https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ProxyFromEnvironment for details.

provider "tls" {
  proxy {
    from_env = true
  }
}

data "tls_certificate" "test" {
  url = "https://example.com"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `proxy` (Block List) Proxy used by resources and data sources that connect to external endpoints. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--proxy))

<a id="nestedblock--proxy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `proxy`

Optional:

- `from_env` (Boolean) When `true` the provider will discover the proxy configuration from environment variables. This is based upon [`http.ProxyFromEnvironment`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ProxyFromEnvironment) and it supports the same environment variables (default: `true`).
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password used for Basic authentication against the Proxy.
- `url` (String) URL used to connect to the Proxy. Accepted schemes are: `http`, `https`, `socks5`.
- `username` (String) Username (or Token) used for Basic authentication against the Proxy.

## Limitations

### `ECDSA` with `P224` elliptic curve

When using `ECDSA` with `P224`, all the (computed) attributes
that have to do with [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) will have a value of `""` (empty string).
This applies to different resources and data sources offered by this provider,
like the `tls_private_key` resource or the `tls_public_key` data source.

The attributes affected are:

* `.public_key_openssh`
* `.private_key_openssh`
* `.public_key_fingerprint_md5`
* `.public_key_fingerprint_sha256`

This is because the SSH ECC Algorithm Integration ([RFC 5656](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5656))
restricts support for elliptic curves to "nistp256", "nistp384" and "nistp521".

### Secrets and Terraform state

Some resources that can be created with this provider, like `tls_private_key`, are
considered "secrets", and as such are marked by this provider as _sensitive_, so to
help practitioner to not accidentally leak their value in logs or other form of output.

It's important to remember that the values that constitute the "state" of those
resources will be stored in the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state) file.
This includes the "secrets", that will be part of the state file *unencrypted*.

Because of these limitations, **use of these resources for production deployments is _not_ recommended**.
Failing that, **protecting the content of the state file is strongly recommended**.

The more general advice is that it's better to generate "secrets" outside of Terraform,
and then distribute them securely to the system where Terraform will make use of them.
