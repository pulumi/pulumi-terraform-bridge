Use the GitLab provider to interact with GitLab resources, like
users, groups, projects and more. You must configure the provider with
the proper credentials before you can use it.

The provider uses the [`xanzy/go-gitlab`](https://github.com/xanzy/go-gitlab) library
to interact with the [GitLab REST API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/api_resources.html).

Each data source and resource references the appropriate upstream GitLab REST API documentation,
which may be consumed to better understand the behavior of the API.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the valid data sources and resources.
