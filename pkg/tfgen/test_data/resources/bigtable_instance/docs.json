If not set, whatever is already set for the cluster will not change, or if the cluster is just being created, it will use the default value of 2560 for SSD clusters and 8192 for HDD clusters.\n\n!\u003e **Warning**: Only one of `autoscaling_config` or `num_nodes` should be set for a cluster.

This means that new and existing `\"DEVELOPMENT\"` instances will be converted to\n`\"PRODUCTION\"` instances. It is recommended for users to use `\"PRODUCTION\"` instances in any case, since a 1-node `\"PRODUCTION\"` instance\nis functionally identical to a `\"DEVELOPMENT\"` instance, but without the accompanying restrictions."
